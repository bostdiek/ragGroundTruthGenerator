# Testing Implementation Status

## Testing Layers Implemented

- [x] **Unit Tests**: Added tests for utility functions, hooks, auth service, and isolated components
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Created an integration test for the authentication flow
- [x] **E2E Tests**: Set up configuration for Playwright and created example tests

## Test Architecture Implemented

- [x] **Page Object Model**: Created abstractions for page interactions in `src/testing/page-objects/index.ts`
- [x] **API Mocking Layer**: Set up MSW for API mocking in `src/testing/mocks/handlers.ts`
- [x] **Test Data Factories**: Implemented factories for generating test data in `src/testing/factories/index.ts`

## Implementation Approach Applied

- [x] **Testing in Isolation**: Implemented unit tests that focus on contract boundaries
- [x] **Behavior-Driven Testing**: Structured tests around user behavior
- [x] **Contract Testing**: Defined interfaces for API responses and test data

## Testing Tools Set Up

- [x] **Vitest**: Configured as the test runner
- [x] **Testing Library**: Used for rendering and querying components
- [x] **MSW**: Set up for API mocking
- [x] **Playwright**: Configured for E2E testing
- [x] **Test Data Generation**: Created factories for consistent test data

## Next Steps

1. **Increase Test Coverage**:
   - Add more component tests
   - Add tests for remaining services
   - Add tests for all custom hooks

2. **Refine Integration Tests**:
   - Add tests for collection management
   - Add tests for QA pair creation and editing

3. **Complete E2E Testing Setup**:
   - Install Playwright dependencies
   - Implement critical user journey tests

4. **Testing Documentation**:
   - Add examples for all test types
   - Document test data factories
   - Create guidelines for writing maintainable tests

The testing infrastructure is now in place to support the frontend refactoring according to Bulletproof React principles.
