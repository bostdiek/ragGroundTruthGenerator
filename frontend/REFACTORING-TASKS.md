## Implementation Notes

- This project is meant to be a template and flexible, not necessarily the most robust
- The architecture should be easy to understand
- Each task should be followed by running tests to ensure nothing is broken
- The code should allow developer teams to either use it directly or easily transport these ideas to another framework or library
