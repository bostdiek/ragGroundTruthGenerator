# Docker Development Setup Complete

## What we've set up

1. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend
   - Created a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the services

2. **Advanced Development Tools**:
   - Integrated uv for extremely fast Python package management
   - Added Ruff for high-performance linting and formatting
   - Created pyproject.toml for Ruff configuration
   - Added pre-commit hooks for code quality

3. **Simple Authentication Provider**:
   - Implemented a simple JWT-based authentication for development
   - Created user templates with demo credentials

4. **Simple Database Provider**:
   - Implemented an in-memory database for development
   - Set up basic CRUD operations for collections and QA pairs

5. **Template Generation and Retrieval**:
   - Created template implementations for text generation
   - Created template implementations for document retrieval

6. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up environment variables for easy customization
   - Created a provider factory system for easy swapping of implementations

7. **Fixed Dependencies**:
   - Updated Azure OpenAI dependency to use correct package names

## How to run the project

1. Start the entire stack:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the application:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - API Documentation: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

3. Login using the demo credentials:
   - Username: `demo@example.com`
   - Password: `password`

## Development Tools

### uv for Package Management

We've integrated [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a super-fast Python package manager written in Rust that's 10-100x faster than pip.

```bash
# Inside the backend container
uv pip install <package-name>  # Install a package
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt  # Update requirements
```

### Ruff for Linting and Formatting

We've added [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), an extremely fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust that replaces tools like Flake8, Black, and isort.

```bash
# Inside the backend container
ruff check .  # Check code for issues
ruff format .  # Format code
ruff check --fix .  # Check and fix issues
```

## Next steps

1. Test the implementation and fix any issues
2. Improve the development environment as needed
3. Add more complete documentation
4. Implement production-ready providers for:
   - Authentication (Azure AD, Auth0, etc.)
   - Database (MongoDB, CosmosDB, etc.)
   - Storage (Azure Blob Storage, S3, etc.)
   - Generation (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, etc.)
   - Retrieval (Azure Cognitive Search, Elasticsearch, etc.)

See README-docker.md for more details on running the project locally.
